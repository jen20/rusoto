//! <p>Amazon WorkLink is a cloud-based service that provides secure access to internal websites and web apps from iOS phones. In a single step, your users, such as employees, can access internal websites as efficiently as they access any other public website. They enter a URL in their web browser, or choose a link to an internal website in an email. Amazon WorkLink authenticates the user's access and securely renders authorized internal web content in a secure rendering service in the AWS cloud. Amazon WorkLink doesn't download or store any internal web content on mobile devices.</p>
//!
//! If you're using the service, you're probably looking for [WorklinkClient](struct.WorklinkClient.html) and [Worklink](trait.Worklink.html).
