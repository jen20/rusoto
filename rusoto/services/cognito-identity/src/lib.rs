//! <p><fullname>Amazon Cognito Federated Identities</fullname> <p>Amazon Cognito Federated Identities is a web service that delivers scoped temporary credentials to mobile devices and other untrusted environments. It uniquely identifies a device and supplies the user with a consistent identity over the lifetime of an application.</p> <p>Using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with one or more third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon) or an Amazon Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to support unauthenticated access from your app. Cognito delivers a unique identifier for each user and acts as an OpenID token provider trusted by AWS Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials.</p> <p>For a description of the authentication flow from the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flow.html">Authentication Flow</a>.</p> <p>For more information see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html">Amazon Cognito Federated Identities</a>.</p></p>
//!
//! If you're using the service, you're probably looking for [CognitoIdentityClient](struct.CognitoIdentityClient.html) and [CognitoIdentity](trait.CognitoIdentity.html).
